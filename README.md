 My ID calculation was 1+3-6 = -4 so my questions are even number related.  
 
 ## Wallpaper
 For the wallpaper I uses a simple diffused normal map that takes in a normal map as well as a material and colour.

I paired this with a created texture and normal map. to have the rough bumpy wall feeling.

## Lava
Remembering how toon lava was done before, I decided to use a toonramp for my lava effects to have more control on where the brightest and more saturated parts of the shading were. This added movement in the moving lava script would add life to the scene and be able to be toggled with a

## Bloom
For bloom, it iterates upon the rendered view, making bright parts look more saturated and brighter, in the process adding mmore

Since I was unsure if this would be enough to count as an extra shader, I added an outline pass to the shader.  This adds a layer behind the object which extrudes the verticies of the object an colours it based on the given Extrusion Amount and Extrusion colour.
